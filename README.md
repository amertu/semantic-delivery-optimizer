## Project Overview
Developed a semantic framework to optimize order coordination across multiple delivery services, leveraging ontologies and knowledge graphs for intelligent data integration.

## Key Features
- **Semantic Integration**: Designed and implemented an ontology-based system to unify data from 4+ delivery service providers.
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, JavaScript, Docker, Protégé, RDF, SPARQL, RDF4J, and GraphDB.
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Utilized RDF and SPARQL to create a scalable and flexible knowledge graph for querying and reasoning.
- **System Architecture**: Deployed services using Docker to ensure modularity and scalability.

## Business Impact
- **Optimized Delivery Coordination**: Improved route planning and order synchronization, resulting in significantly reduced delivery times.
- **Enhanced Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined inter-system communication, leading to better service reliability and a superior user experience.
